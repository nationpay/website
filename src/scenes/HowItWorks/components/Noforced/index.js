                                <li>Assets are controlled via the same voting process and governance procedures as before.  Only now the procedure is available and recordable through blockchain</li>
                                <li>Dividends paid out with the same frequency as before, only now they are paid to just one account and automatically distributed blockchain</li>
                                <li>The society of each RSO on the RealSafe blockchain consists of the original owners at inception. They create a market by listing any quantity of their tokens on the RealSafe Marketplace at anytime.</li>
                                <li>Blockchain records all exchanges, voting operations and other communications as RealSafe transactions for all time.</li>
                                <li>No more minutes in books are necessary.  Any votable issue is maintainable through the RealSafe platform</li>
                                <li>Each RSO has separate voting tokens for the case where the voting rights are not the same as the ownership rights</li>

                                <li>Tokens representing each RSO are transferred through unique RealSafe generated contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.</li>
                                <li>All RSO sub-tokens are erc-20 compliant.  Therefore, if an RSO restricts token trading to a small subgroup of persons, Realsafe controls this via tokens swapped on the RealSafe marketplace.
                                If RSO owner has all regulation in place as a public security with unlimited owners, he may also list his token on any crypto exchange.  </li>
                                <li>Most important, if a transfer is found fraudulent in a court of law, the court may require temporary suspension of trading, reversal or closure of the RSO - as it could in the real world. </li>
                                <li>These compliant features are engagable when voted in.  Assuming the tokens are not listed on any exchange outside the RealSafe MarketPlace, they are enforceable.</li>
                                <li>An RSO may require that no tokens may be transferred more than once per some-unit timeframe or at some minimum quantity or maximum number of owners.</li>
                                <li>RealSafe will provide an unprecendented level of control and security for organizations that demand it to make regulatory compliance easy to acheive with the maximum tradeability.</li>
                                <li>Many corporations need this type of protection that no existing platform can offer.</li>
                                <li>RealSafe unique features designed to handle real-world corporate affairs, such as KYC levels for reporting on end-of-year partners invites new markets onto blockchain for the first time.</li>
